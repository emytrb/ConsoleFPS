# ConsoleFPS - An attempt at creating a simple doomlike FPS in the terminal

This is my attempt at creating a first person shooter that runs on a terminal using C++. I was heavily helped by [this video]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw)) and tweaked the software with personal changes.

The project was made using Visual Studio.
